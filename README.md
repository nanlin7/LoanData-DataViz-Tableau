Final Version: https://public.tableau.com/profile/nan5353#!/vizhome/ProsperLoanDataVisualization/Story1?publish=yes

In this project, the objective is to throw light on default rate of different borrowers in peer to peer lending investment. Through visualizing default rate data by borrowers' income, occupation, prosper score, state, and related return, the audience can therefore choose borrowers more wisely based on their risk tolerance. 

## Design

The story is started with a line chart to indicate the trend of the number of loan records and the total amount over time. Dual axis makes it possible to display two visuals in the one plot and we can compare the patterns over time.
